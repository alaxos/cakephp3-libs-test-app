# CakePHP test application

This sample application can be used to test code of the `alaxos/cakephp3-libs` plugin and the `alaxos/cakephp3-bootstrap-theme`.

The pages contained in this application are generated by using `bake` shell with the `alaxos/cakephp3-bootstrap-theme` templates.

They can be baked again by using the `bake-force` script:

```bash
$ ./bin/bake-force
```

The application source code can be found here: [alaxos/cakephp3-libs-test-app](https://github.com/alaxos/cakephp3-libs-test-app).

## Running tests

### 1. Install the test application

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alaxos/cakephp3-libs-test-app.git

$ cd cakephp3-libs-test-app/

$ composer install

                'password' => 'secret',
                'database' => 'cakephp3-libs-test',
